# Text Encrypter

This is a improved version of the Challenge: encriptador de texto, proposed by Alura & ORACLE ONE for their course Programa ONE - Oracle Next Education: GRUPO 7.

I made it again as there were some aspects of the original I quite did not like but I'll improve the original to the best of my actual skills as well. As for this one, besides some issiues with the interface in certain devices, it works pretty nice in a Samsung TAB S6 lite 2024, a MOTO G72 and a 1920 x 1080 screen.
